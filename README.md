# How to use this app.

### Stopwatch
- Find something meaningful to do and tap anywhere on the screen to start the stopwatch. Note that during this time, you should be completely focused on your chosen activity.
- When the stopwatch is activated, a drop of water will fall every two seconds. You can pause/play the clock with another single tap.
- Reset the stopwatch when you're done by tapping twice. The water you accumulated will now be added towards your total amount of drops.

# Why it works.
The human brain can be illogical. Sometimes we don't want to do the things we know we should do. This is likely do to the fact that the rewards appear too far into the future and/or are difficult to see in the present.
This app tackles this issue by representing progress down to the second. It essentially provides a sense of constant instant gratification where some long-term goals lack.

# What to use this app for?
Any long term habit/goal in which progress can be sometimes difficult to visualize. Some examples below.
- Language Learning
- Practing an instrument
- Exercise / Sport
- Studying for school
- Reading
- Meditation
- Journaling
- Creating Art

## Features
- soft bell sound at an adjustable time interval
- money conversion since time is money!
- personal statistics

# FAQ

### Why a stopwatch instead of a timer?
A timer involves thinking about when to stop before even starting. In terms of user experience, I want the act of starting to be as effortless as possible. 

### Why have it drop every two seconds instead of one?
A drop every second was visually too fast, making it distracting.

### Why doesn't the stopwatch continue to count when I exit the app?
This prevents users from using their phone during the time they should be focused on your chosen activity.
